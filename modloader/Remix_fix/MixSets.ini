ExampleInt        = 100     # (50; 0-200) In this example, by default it is "50" and you can use a number between "0" and "200". Using "-1" MixSets will do nothing (i.e. setting is disabled).
ExampleFloat      = 20.0    # (10.0)      In this example, by default it is "10.0", and you can use any number. Using "-1" MixSets will do nothing. Remember that "-1.0" is considered "-1", so do not use exactly "-1.0".

[Mod]
Enabled       = 1     # (0|1) Enable this mod. Set "0" for MixSets not to load.

Language      = 2     # (1 = Portugu s | 2 = English) Language of in-game warnings.

# Entering the command below during gameplay will reload this .ini.
# However, keep in mind that many things cannot be reloaded, for example enable/disable commands, usually after enabling there is no way to disable it until you restart the game.
ReloadCommand = SETS

# (0|1) Do not load settings from the "Densities" section. This is just a quick way to disable increased car numbers, viewing distance etc.
# Remember: you can also set to decrease distances etc instead of increasing.
NoDensities   = 0

# (0|1) Load functions that are considered DISADVANTAGES into SAMP. Not recommended for playoffs, but you may prefer for roleplay.
# Note: All functions that are considered cheating are NEVER LOADED! MixSets does not cause SAMP cheating, question servers that ban it!
SAMPdisadvantage    = 1

# (0|1) Load viewing distance settings into SAMP.
# Some servers consider this to be cheating, so here is the option.
# Obviously harmless things like shadow distance and car LOD are not included (always loaded).
LoadDistancesOnSAMP = 0




[System]
# (30) FPS limit when frame limiter is enabled in the menu. There is no longer "FPSlimit = AUTO" option due to the Vigilante Framerate mod.
# Above 30 FPS the game has bugs, it is recommended to use a maximum of 60 FPS with Vigilante Framerate mod: https://www.mixmods.com.br/2019/06/framerate-vigilante.html
FPSlimit = 150

# (3; 1-6) Game executable process priority. Use a number between 1 and 5, with 3 being normal priority. It is not recommended to use "6" as inputs may fail or be delayed.
# High values can increase FPS on weak CPUs, such as a "game booster".
# When set, MixSets will lower the priority to "1" when the game is unfocused (eg minimizing).
ProcessPriority = 5

# (50; up to 2048) Memory used for streaming, in MB (where 2048 = 2 GB). Streaming is the process of loading models, textures etc from disk to RAM.
# Increase: It will allow the use of HD models and textures, more objects loaded etc without causing the map to disappear. In addition, it will decrease disk usage but increase RAM usage.
# Decrease: Will decrease RAM usage but will increase disk usage. Map objects may disappear or flicker unlike above.
# Try to increase only what is needed for your game. 128 or 256 is suitable for most cases, 512 if you use many HD model and texture mods. Avoid values above 1024 if you do not use executable with LargeAddress: mixmods.com.br/2016/09/largeaddress-recognize-4-gb-ram.html
StreamMemory = 1900
