Welcome to the GTASA RTX-Remix Project! This project is dedicated to enhancing the GTA San Andreas gameplay experience through the integration of RTX technology. Join our community of modders and enthusiasts as we bring stunning visual upgrades to the world of GTA San Andreas.

# Requirements
To get started with the GTASA RTX-Remix Project, ensure that you have the following:

- **RTX-Compatible Graphics Card**: You'll need an NVIDIA RTX series graphics card to take full advantage of the RTX enhancements.
- **Modding Tools**: Install the necessary modding tools, such as Mod Loader to simplify the mod installation process.
- **Downgrade**: For better compatibility, you'll need to downgrade to version 1.0 in order to run the game with RTX-Remix.
- **RTX-Remix**: Get the latest version of RTX-Remix from [RTX-Remix GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix) and download the release. Make sure to update the "bridge-remix" and "dxvk-remix" files in the Action Tab. The latest version includes support for DLSS 3 frame generation.

# Mod Installation
