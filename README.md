# GTASA RTX-Remix Project
Welcome to the GTASA RTX-Remix Project! This project is dedicated to enhancing the GTA San Andreas gameplay experience through the integration of RTX technology. Join our community of modders and enthusiasts as we bring stunning visual upgrades to the world of GTA San Andreas.

# Requirements
To get started with the GTASA RTX-Remix Project, ensure that you have the following:

- **GTA San Andreas Game**: Make sure you have a legally obtained copy of GTA San Andreas installed on your computer.
- **RTX-Compatible Graphics Card**: You'll need an NVIDIA RTX series graphics card to take full advantage of the RTX enhancements.
- **Modding Tools**: Install the necessary modding tools, such as ModLoader and MoonLoader.
- **Downgrade**: For better compatibility, you'll need to downgrade to version 1.0 in order to run the game with RTX-Remix.
- **RTX-Remix**: Get the latest version of RTX-Remix from [RTX-Remix GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix) and download the release. Make sure to update the "bridge-remix" and "dxvk-remix" files in the Action Tab.
- You can use [RTX-Remix-Downloader](https://github.com/Kowlin/RTX-Remix-Downloader/releases/latest/download/RTX.Remix.Downloader.exe) to download and update to lastest version of RTX-Remix). Here is the original Github page of the tool : [RTX-Remix-Downloader](https://github.com/Kowlin/RTX-Remix-Downloader)

# Sun Mod Requirements
This mod changes the sun and moon in GTASA using MoonLoader and Lua scripts.

**Installation** :
- **MoonLoader** : Download and install MoonLoader from the provided link. This will allow you to run Lua scripts in GTASA: [MoonLoader (Russian)](https://www.blast.hk/threads/13305/) or [MoonLoader (English)](https://gtaforums.com/topic/890987-moonloader/).
- **MoonAdditions** : Download MoonAdditions from GitHub. Copy the MoonAdditions.dll file to your MoonLoader/lib folder: [MoonAdditions](https://github.com/THE-FYP/MoonAdditions).
- **SARemix_Sun** : download the "SARemix_Sun.lua" and "SARemix_Real_Sun.dat" files from the moonloader folder. Then copy it into the "game folder\MoonLoader" folder.

  (If you previously installed my sun mod CLEO script, delete it to avoid conflicts.)

# Health Bar Mod Requirements
The Health Bar Mod is a Lua script designed to reveal the original health bar that is hidden in Remix.

**Installation** :
- **MoonLoader** : Download and install MoonLoader from the provided link. This will allow you to run Lua scripts in GTASA: [MoonLoader (Russian)](https://www.blast.hk/threads/13305/) or [MoonLoader (English)](https://gtaforums.com/topic/890987-moonloader/).
- **MoonAdditions** : Download MoonAdditions from GitHub. Copy the MoonAdditions.dll file to your MoonLoader/lib folder: [MoonAdditions](https://github.com/THE-FYP/MoonAdditions).
- **SARemix_HealthBar** : download the hbao.lua file from the moonloader folder. Then copy it into the "game folder\MoonLoader" folder.

  (If you've installed the sun mod, it means you already have moonloader and MoonAdditions installed, so there's **no need** to reinstall it.)


# Mod Installation :
Follow these steps to install the GTASA RTX-Remix mod:
- **Backup**: Before installing any mods, it's highly recommended to create a backup of your GTA San Andreas game files. This will allow you to revert back to the original game state if needed.
- **Download**:

    **1**. Navigate to [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and click "**Download for Windows**" to download the installer file.

    **2**. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process.

    **3**. Once installed, open GitHub Desktop and sign into your account.

    **4**. In the mod's GitHub repository page top right corner click "Code" then "Open with GitHub Desktop".

    **5**. In GitHub Desktop, click "Clone" and select "Your Game Folder\rtx-remix" to clone the repository to.

    (If the rtx-remix folder do not exist, create it manually.)

    **6**. Wait for the cloning process to finish - this may take a few minutes for larger mods.
- **Move File**: place the "rtx.conf" file from the "rtx-config" folder into your game folder.
- **Let's RTX**: Launch GTA San Andreas with RTX enhancements.
